title: How ditching Visual Studio has helped improve my learning of ASP.NET Core
---

Hi everyone.

Just a quick post, I know I haven't kept up with the learning log like I said I would but I have been back at my regular full time job and not had a lot of time,
but I will be trying my hardest to make sure to do atleast a weekly post from now on.

Anyway back to the title of this post. I have recently ditched Visual Studio completely now. I have decided to stick with the dotnet command line tools and to code 
comepletly in VS Code which has now become my favorite editor. There are a few different reasons for this. Firstly is performance, Visual Studio really does not like 
running on my laptop for some reason, for reference I have a Acer Aspire F15 with 8gb Ram, but Visual Studio just stalls and crashes to often for it to not be annoying,
thus far I have had no issues from VS Code.

Secondly I have found myself relying to much on Visual Studio for setting everything up with me and scaffolding pages and I don't beleive this is helping me in the long run.
I am not learning why these things happen and how to make it happen myself and I think this has been damaging my learning. Since ditch Visual Studio I have begun to understand
a lot more about how ASP.NET Core applications are running and how I can customise this to specific application needs.

I am going to see how this goes over time, but my opinion so far is I can't see myself going back to Visual Studio, atleast on my own machine, things might be different
if I were to get a job and was given a proper development machine which could handle Visual Studio.

Anyway that's enough from me.

Hope you are staying safe during the pandemic.
