title: So I've finished the  Team Treehouse ASP.NET basics course!
---

After a few nights spent glued to the laptop I've finally finished the ASP.NET MVC basics course on Team Treehouse. 
I personally found it a great starting point to get into .NET MVC development. The course is taught using .NET 4.6 and I know
everyone is working on .NET Core now but from what I've read the differences aren't to major and its easy to pick up. 

The course taught alot of basics such as:

-Controllers and abstracting to a Data layer
-Routing
-Razor views
-Modelling Data in C# classes
-Using Github inside Visual Studio (Which I absolutely love!)

I've still got a long way to go and Im about to start their next course which is ASP.NET MVC forms. I still need to learn about Entity 
Framework, connecting a MVC app to a database and how to authenticate and authorise users, luckily there is courses available for all those
things.

You can see the repo for the project built during this first course on my Github page, also heres a

so if you're interested take a look!
