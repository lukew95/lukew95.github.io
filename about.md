Hi! Im Luke, I'm 24 and I live in Nottingham in the UK!

I currently work as a Fire and Security System Engineer but I am looking to move my career into Full Stack JavaScript development. I'm currently learning MERN through https://teamtreehouse.com and other books and resources. I hope to post a learning log on here as well as some tutorials to help me put my learning together.
