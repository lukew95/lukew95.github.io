Hi! Im Luke, I'm 24 and I live in Nottingham in the UK!

I currently work as a Fire and Security System Engineer but I am looking to move my career into Full Stack JavaScript development. I'm currently self learning Full Stack JavaScript Development on (https://www.theodinproject.com)[https://www.theodinproject.com/]. I hope to post a learning log on here as well as some tutorials to help me put my learning together.
