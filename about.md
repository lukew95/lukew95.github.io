Hi! Im Luke, I'm 24 and I live in Nottingham in the UK!

I currently work as a Fire and Security System Engineer but I am looking to move my career into C# and .Net Core development. I am self teaching through a variety of different methods, I am using Pluralsight, Udemy and a few books off of Apress, if anyone would like to know any specific courses I have taken then feel free to get in contact with me. I hope to post a learning log on here as well as some tutorials to help me put my learning together.
